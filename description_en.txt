Vertical Speed (VSPD) is a data field to show the vertical speed based on local barometric pressure. It logs statistical information to the Activity and shows the vertical speed  graph in the Connect Mobil App or on the Connect Website. 
Enable data recording and presenting in settings(!)

VSPD is also known as: Variometer, rate of climb and descent indicator (RCDI), rate-of-climb indicator, vertical speed indicator (VSI) or vertical velocity indicator (VVI).

*** WHY ***
Wenn you do sports in the mountains, like Mountaineering, Trail Running, Skitouring, Mountainbiking or Climbing the ascend speed is an important number of your fitness. As the GPS signal can be week in the mountains or even wrong due to reflections it is often more accurate to use the barometric height to calculate the vertical speed. In addition the vertical speed value provided by Garmin by default is rounded to the next 50 m/s. This accuracy is to vague for serious training.

*** FUNCTIONS ***
1. VSPD is a data field that shows the vertical speed in [m/h]. 
2. VSPD records the vertical speed data to the FIT-file when used during an activity. 
3. The VSPD recorded data will be presented as a graph when displaying your Activity in the Garmin Connect Website.
4. Record Ø ascent speed in LAP statistic.
5. Record time in speed zones in summary statistic.
6. Configure in settings what data should be recorded and shown.

*** CONFIGURE the VSPD datafield in the APP SETTINGS ***
*** disable the additional statistic and graphs ***
- Enable/Disable VSPD recording and graph
- Enable/Disable Ø ascent speed in LAP
- Enable/Disable ascend speed zones statistic
- Record ascend speed only (suppress descent speed, this can improve readability)
- LAP Ø : average ascend speed. Calculated during time you actually ascend. (Minimal ascend needs to be 50m).

* Detailed Algorithm *
vspd = delta h / delta t 

Unfortunately the pressure sensors of the devices are not very accurate and the data is quite noisy.  This is the algorithm to smoothen it. Its not perfect. The problem is that it is an balance between smoothness and reactiveness. 
a) As datasource the ambient (local) barometric pressure as measured by the pressure sensor will be used. This source data comes smoothed by a two-stage filter to reduce noise and instantaneous variation.
b) In addition the value are smoothes  by a Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA) filter with factor a = 0.15 of the newest measurement.
c) The vertical speed calculated over a 30 second time period.
d) VSPD is rounded on 10 m/h.
e) The measurement is done every second.
f) VSPD values less than |20| m/h are set to 0

v 0.6.0 Correct units. Improved Algorithm. Changed graph color to Cobalt blue.
v 0.7.0 New Functionality: Configurable in settings. Add Ø ascent speed in LAP. Add time in speed zones in summary statistic.
v 0.7.1 Correct Ø ascent speed LAP statistic. Set EWMA factor to 0.15.
v 0.8.0 Correct bugs in Ø ascent speed LAP statistic. VSPD in LAP statistic will only be shown if LAP ascent is higher than 50 m. Statistic will exclude values during paused or stoped activity.
